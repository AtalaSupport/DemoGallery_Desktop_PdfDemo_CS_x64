# PdfDemo
Demonstrates how to view and save PDF files with DotImage and DotImage 
PdfDecoder.  Rasterizes a small thumbnail of each page in the PDF 
asynchronously while loading the first page in the PDF.  Demonstrates use of the 
ThumbnailView control.

This demo shows some uesful concepts related to PDF using DotImage

One of the more interesting features it has is to use the ExtractImages feature 
of our Atalasoft.Imaging.Codec.Pdf.Document class (not to be confused with 
Atalasoft.PdfDoc.PdfDocument)

This is the C# version. We have a [VB.NET version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_OcrDiagnosticDemo_VB_x64) available.


## Licensing
This application requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging as well as our PdfReader addon. You may also request a 30 day evaulation if youre evaluating if DotImage is right for you.


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. You must have our SDK installed (and licesed per above)

[Download DotImage](https://www.atalasoft.com/BeginDownload/DotImageDownloadPage)


### OmniPage
Our OmniPageEngine has additional OCR resource requirements not included in our main SDK download (they would nearly double the size of the SDK download so we make them available separately to those who wish to use OmniPageEngine). They cna be found here: [INFO: OmniPageEngine Overview](https://www.atalasoft.com/kb2/KB/50396/INFO-OmniPageEngine-Overview)


### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.
